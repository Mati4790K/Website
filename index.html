		  <h1>Welcome</h1>
		  <p>As a student in NTU, in order to achive my full potential, I need to attent Continued Professional Development activities. If I want to achieve my full potetial, I need to 
		  do minimum 30 hours of extra ectivities. This will allow me to develop new skills and improve those that I currently posses. In Term 1 I attended a lot of different activities 
		  and they helped me in developing myself. I joined photography society, which gave me a lot of new oppurtunities. For example I have never been in a studio photoshoot and thanks 
		  to the society, I could be both a model and a photographer in the studio photoshoot. This taught me new skills, because now I know more about light and how to use it to make my 
		  photos look better. Another example is when we went to do a wildlife photoshoot, thanks to the society I had access to amazing zoom lens that I have never used before. The zoom on 
		  this lens was very big and it forced me to think more about what photos I could take with that lens. I also realized that I don't need that kind of lens in my camera bag, mainly 
		  because of its size and weight.</p>
		  
		  <p>I also attended few Global Lounge meetings where we practiced different languages and talked about our cultures. We played different games to pratice languages (e.g. me and 5 
		  Spanish people praticed English by playing a game where we had to create a collective story). We then talked about our cultures and are they different from each other e.g. we talked
		  how weddings in our coutries are different and whan we do on our weddings. Then we were talking about our current society that we live in and we talked about Black Mirror Tv series, 
		  which shows how technology and differnt people can affect the world and societies and that it shows how our world can look like in bad scenarios.</p>
		  
		  <p>In the Digital Horizon week I attended two revision sessions for Programing strand and Technology strand (see first photo from left). I also attended one web surgery (second photo from left) because 
		  I wasn't sure how I have to code my navigation bar, and on the surgery I got a clear answer to how I need to do it. On Wednesday I attended workshop where we discussed our goals and plans, we worked 
		  on that in groups and it was really nice worshop to have. After that I went to a Employability Marketplace (third photo from left) where 5 previous NTU students came and gave us speech about what they 
		  did after university and they gave us tips on what we should do in university and that we should use oppurtunities that we have. The last session that I went to on Wednesday was a Employability Marketplace 
		  where Dr. Aygul Zagidullia did a presentation for us about Google Assistant and how to develop for Google Assistant (fourth photo from left), which was very inforamtive and very interesting. After the 
		  presentation we had an oppurtunity to create our own Google Assistant application where user told their favourite colour and Google Assistant would tell user how many letters are in the colour. 
		  Below you can see some photos from Digital Horizon week.</p>

		  <p>Last year I started doing a computer game. This is a tower defense strategy game, where user has to use different towers and strategies to win the game. I really liked the game and I keep 
		  working on it. Since September I added a lot of different features to my game e.g. I added main menu for the game, where player can visit options menu, credits menu, exit the game or play the game.
		  I use Unity game engine to create it and I created all 3D assets by myself using Blender 3D editing software.
