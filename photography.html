				<img class="phot" src="images/first_photo.JPG" alt="My First Photo" title="One of my first photos">
				One of my biggest hobby and passion is photography. I got my first compact camera when I was 8 years old. Photo on the right shows one of my first photos taken on my camera.
				It had very limited functions but for me it was enough to fel in love with photography. After 6 years my camera broke and I had to buy new camera. I bought newer model of my camera, 
				and now when I think about it, I think that buying a DSLR camera would be a better choice, but maybe I wasn't ready for it back then. After few years with my new compact camera I started to notice 
				that it is limiting me. I knew some photography tehniques that I wanted to try but my camera didn't allow me to try them. Then I realized that if I want to be a better phototgrapher, I need to buy 
				a DSLR camera. So 3 years ago I bought my current camera Nikon D7200 and it offered much better photo quality than my compact camera. Finally my photos were looking more professional and I could try 
				more advanced techniques. When I started University, the first thing that I did was signing up to photography society.
				Currently I am very happy member of this society. Our society organises a lot of meetings where we all meet and shoot pictures together.

			<h1 style="line-height:1.9;">My first meeting with photography society</h1>
			<p>On 15th of October I went to my first meeting organised by photography society. That day we met to do a night photography in Nottingham city centre. 
			I've never tried night photography in big city before so that was new experience for me. At the begging I didn't know what to do, what kind of photos should I take, 
			but because I was there with my friends, I watched them and if their results were great, I tried to do simiar pictures. I didn't take too many good pictures that day, 
			but that was my first time and I'm still happy from the results. Right at the end of the meeting we noticed awesome spot with neon lights and we thought it will be great for portraits. 
			We were right. Portraits came out really good and we were so happy because even we didn't expect them to be that good. The meeting started at 18:30 and we finished at 22:30 
			which means we were there for 4 hours.</p>

			<h1 style="line-height:1.9;">Editing session the next day</h1>
			<p> When we shoot our photos, we use special lossless file format for images called RAW. This means that we need to edit every single photo before we can post it online. 
			We also are not experienced in photo editing so we thought it would be a good idea to first edit our photos by our selves and then meet together, discuss and reedit our photos if necessary. 
			When we met we discussed our edits and realised that we can change a lot of things in our edits e.g. add graduated filter to bring more colours to photos; good idea was to use split toning in editing software.
			Split tonning was very helpful in portrait shots because it allowed us to extract the blue light which matched red light perfectly. We spent 2 hours on discussion and editing but it was worth it, 
			we learned new techniques in photo editing</p>

			<h1 style="line-height:1.9;">Studio photoshoot</h1>
			<p>On 1st of November we had another society meeting. This time we did a studio photoshoot where we could play with lighting and see how to set up light in the studio. 
			We were there for 2 hours and during that time we learned quite a lot. I learned more about diffusors and direct ligt source. We played with colour gels that we put on the light source to achieve 
			unique lighting (see photos below)</p>

			<h1 style="line-height:1.9;">Wildlife photoshoot</h1>
			<p> On 16th of November we went to a Wollaton Hall, Gardens and Deer Park to do a wildlife photoshoot. We planned to take some photos of wild animals and we hoped to see some deers. 
			When we started walking we noticed a deer that was laying on the ground (see photos below), and we started to shoot some photos. Then I was given an opportunity to try a new lens,
			that I haven't used before. It was Nikon 200mm-500mm f5.6. This lens was very big and quite heavy but it allows to zoom in on a subject, so I could stand really far from the subject 
			and still have the subject fill my photo. Because I was one of few people who had Nikon camera, I could use this lens for a long time and that taught me a lot new things. Because I have 
			never used a lens like that, I had to learn it's limitations e.g. it was very hard to take a photo of a close object. I also know that for the most of my photos I don't need a lens like this
			and it's really hard to travel with because of its size. Overall I'm very happy that I could use this lens becasue I love to learn and try new things in photography.</p>
