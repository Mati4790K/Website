		  <h1>About Me</h1>
		  
		  <p>I'm 20 years old and I study Computer Science at Nottingham Trent University. I've moved into UK four years ago, on 14th of November 2015. 
		  For four years I've lived in small town in Lincolnshire called Boston. Before I came to Boston, I googled it to see what I can expect. When I 
		  arrived to Boston I was quite suprised becasue as it turned out, Google gave me results for Boston in USA, which is much bigger than this in UK.

				<h1 style="font-size:60px; text-align: center;">My passion to photography</h1>
				<br>
				<p class="par">I liked photography since I remember. I got my first camera when I was 8 years old, and slowly I was learning photography. 
				The real photography adventure started when I was limited by my compact camera and three years ago I bought proper DSLR camera. With DSLR 
				camera I could finally take photos that I always wanted. For three years I was learning my camera and I collected a lot of differnt lenses 
				that helped me to achieve the look of my photos that I always wanted. Currently I have 6 lenses and I'm still planning to buy more.</p>

		  <p>There is an interesting fact about me. Every four years I move out. This is true since I was born. When I was four years old I moved out for the first time. We moved out to a city that was 80km (50 miles)
		  away from my first home. When I was 8 years old I moved out outside the city so we can live closer to the nature. When I was 12 years old I moved to the same city where I lived for the first time, but it was 
		  around 11km (7 miles) from my first home. When I was 16 years old I've moved out to UK and now, when I'm 20, I've moved out to Nottingham to study here. I want to do a placement year which means I will study 
		  in Nottingham for four years and after that I will probably move out again.</p>

					<h1 style="font-size:60px; text-align: center;">My passion to computing</h1>
					<br>
					<p class="par2">I liked technology since I remember. I got my first computer when I was 8 years old, but I didn't know anything about computers at that time. 
					Everything changed when my computer broke. Becasue I didn't want to pay anyone I said that I have to fix it myself. I found out that it was the GPU, so I bought new one. However, I knew that soon 
					other parts will break as well so it was time to change my computer (I was 12 years old at that time). For one year I was learning how to build a computer, how to choose parts, how to connect 
					everything together. After one year of preparing and reading about computers, I was ready to buy my new computer. Everything went very well and I have this computer till this day, and because of that
					I liked computing more. I wanted to learn programming but I was 13 years old and I didn't know how. When I moved in to UK, in college we learned programming and I loved it. The problem solving, logical 
					thinking, I just love that.</p>
